  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Anyone in a civilization has been exposed to someone with more experience and understanding at some point. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization#Cultural_identity">Great human civilizations</a> have been build with the power of that knowledge. Those who knew something that others didn’t, shared it for the greater good of their community.</p>

<p>The learning process depends in a lot of factors. Some factors are in the student, some are in the teacher, some are in the communication, some are in the society.</p>

<p>If you find yourself teaching and you really want to share what you know, there are some things you need to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The audience needs to be willing to learn.</li>
  <li>It is not enough to have the understanding, you have to be able to explain it in a way that is easy for others to understand.</li>
  <li>To explain the main concept, you may need to provide the missing gaps in the audience’s knowledge, and that implies being able to identify them as soon as they appear.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have those in mind <strong>you are in the right track</strong>. Although <strong>it can be better</strong>: you can use a bit of psychology.</p>

<p>We are humans. We are social-driven species. Your interactions with your students are an essential part in the success of your teaching.
Have you ever wondered why so many kids think a teacher holds animosity toward them? <em>even if that is not true</em>? (Are you sure it isn’t?)</p>

<ul>
  <li>You have to be in a relationship with your students that <a href="https://psychologies.co.uk/self/how-to-boost-your-natural-feelgood-chemicals.html">feels good</a>.</li>
  <li>You need to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_psychology#Motivation">motivate</a> your students.</li>
  <li>You should <a href="http://ecomba.pro/2015/03/14/care/">transmit your enthusiasm</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you think the students are the only ones responsible for that, think again: Do you really care of the <strong>success of your students</strong>? Yo may be creating animosity towards your students.</p>

<p>In some places, the reputation of a teacher is measured by the amount of students that have successfully learnt from him/her. The core concept is true. Although, it can be easily distorted if the rewards are related to that measure.</p>

<p>Even if you have a good relationship with your students, there is a mistake that can destroy all the previous motivation.
I still find myself making it sometimes. But when I notice it, I try to fix it asap. That mistake is in how the feedback is given. And I see it quite frequently in the way other people give feedback.</p>

<p>If you are a person with an <a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/kevin-liddle/2013/02/18/we-are-principled-1.html">always-improve mentality</a> you may be making the same mistake. It may be related with the self-critical mental process: When I do something, I look for things that I can improve and then try to do it. That leaves me in a never-ending process. If I want to finish what I’m doing, I have to decide when it is good enough <em>for the time being</em>.</p>

<p>So, when I made the mistake in giving feedback, I followed the same process: I was looking for things to improve. I omitted the things that are good. And I did not consider if it was good enough. I assumed that the needed information were only the things that can be improved.</p>

<p>If you mention only the things that can be improved, the main idea is: <code>you have things that are wrong and you better change them</code>.</p>

<p>If you make explicit that <em>it may be good enough</em> or <em>is his decision to improve it</em> and provide suggestions on how to face it, the idea is: <code>it is not bad, but it can be improved and you will have my support</code></p>

<p>And if you add on top of that the good things, the idea is: <code>it is good, and we can make it much better</code></p>

<p>I think you can see the motivation outcome that is going to be from each one.</p>
