  <article class="post-content">
    <p>There are <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?XpSimplicityRules">4 rules</a> that are guidelines when one is seeking for simple design:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tests pass (the code works).</li>
  <li>Expresses intent (is very easy to understand and find the places where the changes should be done).</li>
  <li>No duplication of knowledge.</li>
  <li>Minimal amount of pieces (modules, classes, methods) and code.</li>
</ul>

<p>Doing TDD, the first rule <a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd">is taken for granted</a>.</p>

<p>But with the other three rules, things start to be more fuzzy.</p>

<p>I found out some practices that helped me to make my design close to those guidelines:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start with <a href="http://www.softwaretestingstuff.com/2007/10/top-down-testing-vs-bottom-up-testing.html">top-down</a> testing to guide me in the direction of the pieces that I will need to solve the problem. That makes me avoid doing <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?BigDesignUpFront">BDUF</a>.</li>
  <li>Looking for explanations of the problem in human-language and write down the words that are used to describe it. That way I had a vocabulary to describe the concepts in an un-ambiguous and very clear way.</li>
  <li>When adding tests, focusing on their names as if I was describing it to another person and let those to guide the code’s API (from <a href="https://leanpub.com/4rulesofsimpledesign">Corey Haines’ book</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>I also found out that the definition of simple have different shades for different people. Is interesting to read about their opinions, for example: <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham#The_Simplest_Thing_that_Could_Possibly_Work">Ward Cunninghan</a> or <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">Rich Hickey</a>.</p>

<p>Sometimes I found out other design guidelines pointing me to a bit different directions.</p>

<p>For example: SRP would prefer to have the concerns separated in different places, taking that to the extreme may contradict a bit with:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Minimal amount of pieces</code>: a lot of extremely small pieces.</li>
  <li><code>Expressing intent</code>: very abstract names that are difficult to understand and are not in the domain.</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, I found that I’m unable to conform to all the design guidelines I know. I found out that it is a game of trade-offs. I needed to find the sweet-spot having all of them in mind.</p>
