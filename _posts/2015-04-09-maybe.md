[In the last blog post][hof1] I was writing about the smell of using if statements when a value may be present or not.

In this blog post I'm going to let the code speak by itself.

{% highlight ruby %}
class Author
  include Maybe
   
  def name
    just "Mateu"
  end
end

author = Author.new

puts author.name
  .if{|it| it.include? "a"}
  .change{|it| it.upcase}
  .or{"I don't know"}
{% endhighlight ruby %}
