Giving estimations is one of the hardest things I am learning. I am constantly discovering new things to keep in mind when giving an estimate. This time I'm going to talk about my experience when I don't consider my stress. You may think `your stress has nothing to do with the task that needs to be done`. Well, if I am the person asked for an estimation, I can only say the effort I think will take me to do it.

The problem is that, given several slight underestimations, I still want to have them done no matter the extra effort and without thinking on long term consequences. I know I can do it if necessary, but doing that for too long results in burning out. That is not a [sustainable pace](http://www.infoq.com/news/2013/08/sustainable-pace-achieve-improve).
