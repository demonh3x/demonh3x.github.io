It happens that when we are focused in a topic, we lose the ability to see it in a different way.
You may know the technique of `having a shower` or `going for a walk` to get a fresh point of view. I have been involved in conversations about that topic quite frequently. [Barbara Oakley][barbara] explains [the following][fvd] [about it][using-diffuse]:

`Researchers have found that we have two fundamentally different modes of thinking, here I'll call them the Focused and Diffuse mode. We are either in the Focused mode or in the Diffuse mode of thinking. It seems you can't be at both ways of thinking modes at the same time.`

When we are in the Focused mode, our brains work in constrained zones to maximize the amount of energy spent on an area of knowledge and/or abilities.

`The Focused mode, in some sense, is like if the thought is traveling along a familiar, nicely-paved road. But what if the problem you are working on needs new ideas or approaches, concepts that you haven't thought of before.`

Those may need you to activate a different zone on your brain. `But if you haven't had that thought before, you don't even know where it is. How are we going to reach there in the first place?`

`In the Diffuse mode of thinking you can look at things broadly. You can make new neural connections traveling along new pathways.`

To activate the diffuse mode, `Salvador Dali would relax in his chair and let his mind go free. He'd had a key in his hand and as he would slip into his dreams, falling asleep, the key would fall from his hand and the clatter would wake him up. Just in time so he could gather up those thoughts and ideas in his mind and off he'd go back into the focused mode, bringing with him the new connections he made while in the diffuse mode.`

`According to legend, Thomas Edison would do something similar.`
