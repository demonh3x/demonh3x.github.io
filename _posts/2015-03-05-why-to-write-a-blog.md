One of the first things that is requested in a Resident apprenticeship is to have a personal blog about the experience.   

I tried to write a blog before. I wanted some kind of reference for anyone interested in my work and the things I do.
Maybe I was looking at it with the wrong perspective. A blog may not only be for others to read, but for oneself to improve by consciously expressing the thoughts, expand knowledge or explore new ideas.

But is not easy to have the perseverance to keep writing content. 
Perseverance is tricky to get. It can be thought as managing one's limited willpower. Perseverance is similar to having a habit. There is going to be times when one doesn't feel like doing what needs to be done or there are better things to do. But not doing what needs to be done when that happens is the worst decision. At least do a bit of what you need to do just to get used to doing it regularly. It is also important not to burnout doing it. Try to feel when you are getting tired of doing it and rest.

It is also not easy to have a continuous repertoire of subjects. I'm currently writing down the main ideas I want to talk about. That enables me to expand them when I need to create a post.
