There is one recurring concept I am seeing constantly while developing software and I don't know if such concept has a name. Because of that, I'm going to give it a tentative name: `Complexity Dimensions`.

Although I've been conscious about this concept for approximately 6 months, I still don't know exactly how to describe it. So, instead of trying to find a generic definition, I'm going to give some examples. Hopefully these examples will help me and you find a correct definition and/or the proper name for it.

It is very related to the [transformation priority premise](https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2013/05/27/TheTransformationPriorityPremise.html) and the quote: `As the tests get more specific, the code gets more generic.`

The examples will not be short to go over. To make them more enjoyable, I'm going to do a series of recorded [Katas](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CodeKata).
The first example is going to be [the FizzBuzz kata](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FizzBuzzTest):

In the next part, I'll try to describe what I mean by `Complexity Dimensions` inside this performance.
