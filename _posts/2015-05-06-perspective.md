As I said in [my previous post][post]: I found myself losing time that can be avoided. And recently I found some reasons: 

[post]: /8thlight/2015/05/05/getting-things-done.html

* I don't know how to continue with the story I'm working with.
* I wander through the code for a long time to find what to do next.
* I do things that are not very relevant.

All of them are caused by not having enough perspective of *where I am*, *where I need to go* and *what steps make sense*.

In the [getting things done][wiki] method you need to keep in mind about your goals at different levels:

[wiki]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done#Methodology

* current actions
* current projects
* areas of responsibility
* 1-2 year goals
* 3-5 year goals
* Life

Although I had in mind the intermediate *horizons* until now, I'm lacking in the rest. It's time to change that and improve on my perspective of the *current actions*.
