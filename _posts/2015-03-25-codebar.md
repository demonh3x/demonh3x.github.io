[Codebar][codebar] is a free, weekly, software development workshop based in London where voluntary coaches and interested students meet to enhance the community.

Some of the students have a very basic level. [If you're conscious about the frustration and difficulties happening at the beginning][kickstart], you know that having someone to help you understand and not get frustrated is a really important aspect in that process.

Today is the third time I go to these workshops as a coach.

I'm addicted to the joy and satisfaction when I'm able to transform ideas into reality. I also love that thrilling sensation when discovering completely new things. 

Making other people feel those sensations is not the same as experiencing them yourself but it is not that far. I can empathize with them and be infected with their feelings. 

That makes me happy and proud of what they can accomplish.
