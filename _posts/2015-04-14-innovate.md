We know that, usually, there can be several different solutions to a problem. Each one with a different set of pros and cons.

I think most of us -- problem solvers --, in our experience, have been spoiled by seeing an external solution. At least once. If we try to solve the problem again, most probably, we may end up copying the same solution. Once that happens, it is difficult to see alternatives.

When I want a different solution or I want to expand my knowledge, I try to do the following:

Think on the problem that I want to solve. I think of `what` I want -- that may be composed of more little `what` pieces. Then I think of `how` that solution solved those.

If we think of what a solution is, we may describe it as a set of decisions on `how` to solve each one of the little `what` pieces. [Most of the innovations are made by trying to solve a `what` with more information than the original solver had at the moment][novel-ideas]

Once I have those, I try to think of alternative `how`s. Only by choosing a different `how` on one `what`, It is very possible to end with a different solution. The more different the solution you want it to be, the more `how` you are going to need to change.
