When you think about working for a company, I'm pretty sure you expect to provide some kind of value to them. You may be developing products or doing some kind of service. Something that results in a near-term profit. And that expectation will be reinforced by the fact that you are being paid.

What would you think from a business perspective of a company that has **learning** as the only one initial expectation from their employees? [It may sound like a very bad decision, right?][what-if-they-stay]

But that doesn't mean that any software company can avoid supporting that. Their business is at stake.
