One of the things that I like about vim is the speed at which you can move around the text. There are a lot of ways to reach a certain part of the text via shortcuts or commands. That can create confusion.

I've been using a plugin that simplifies finding and moving around: [easymotion][em]. I like it because it is a simple way to reach other parts. You don't have to think about words, paragraphs or lines. You just search, write part of the text where you want to jump to, and then select one of the occurrences. That's it, you are there, ready to change or add whatever you need.
