title:  "Is Clojure more productive?"

I have been positively surprised this week. Let me put you in context: In my last IPM, I was assigned to do one task: tictactoe in Clojure with perfect AI.

I estimated that story to be finished in 6 days. For several reasons:

* I had never done a project that big with Clojure. But I had done simple katas and some exercises at [4clojure][4clj].
* I am not comfortable implementing the perfect AI yet.
* It took me 4 days and a half to do tictactoe without perfect AI in other languages.

Foreseeing that I would have to work hard to fit those 6 days of work into 4 and a half (the iteration duration), I did the [Clojure koans][koans] in the weekend to get more comfortable with the language.

Through the week, we were doing [daily stand-up][standup]. So I had to think of what I should have finished each day to meet the expectations at the next IPM. I was focusing in these two points:

* What did I accomplish yesterday?
* What will I do today?

[standup]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting#Software_development

First day, I managed to have almost all the game logic working.
Second day, I had the CLI working and a bit of a dumb computer player.
And the third day I finished the perfect AI as the computer player.

I was done! I've done in 3 days what in other languages took me approximately 6 days. I'm sure not all the credit goes to Clojure. I guess the most important factors that led me to that productivity boost were:

* Clojure (Because it is a terse language and has a lot of advanced functionality already built in)
* Daily stand-up and planning the daily objectives
* Having done the same problem before several times
* Focusing on simplicity: just enough to make it work

I'm still surprised.
