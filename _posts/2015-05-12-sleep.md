If you have read [my first journal post][journal], you may have noticed that I wrote the amount of sleep I had each day. 
You may have noticed also that it sometimes is more than expected from an adult, around 9-10 hours.

I'm trying lately to sleep as much as my body needs. I'm trying to wake up by myself and not because an alarm is sounding on my phone. I don't always achieve it. Sometimes I go to sleep too late and the alarm ends up waking me up.

You may wonder why. I'm going to use some quotes from a very concise [lecture][lhtl] from [Dr. Barbara Oakley][barbara] in a MOOC called [Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects][lhtl] to respond to that:

`Sleep, which can sometimes seem like such a waste of time, is actually your brain's way of keeping clean and healthy`  

`Sleep is actually an important part of the memory and learning process`

`Sleep has also been shown to make a remarkable difference in your ability to figure out difficult problems and to understand what you are trying to learn`
